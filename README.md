# moodle-xmltocsv

This project is work in progress and was created to provide a fast solution
for a teacher that wanted a CSV export of his question.

The mc2csv.php script is a fast and dirty solution that works for this
specific case. From the Moodle XML file only the multiple choice question
are transformed into a CSV file.

If you are interested in other question types or encounter errors in the
transformation, please open an issue.

The script itself contains a brief documentation on how to use it by
typing: php mc2csv.php --help
